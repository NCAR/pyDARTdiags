# Summary

pyDARTdiags is a Python package for manipulating observation sequences and calculating 
observation-space diagnostics for the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). 

Data assimilation is a scientific technique that combines observations (such as measurements from
weather satellites, buoys, radar, or other sensors) with predictions from numerical models to produce
an improved estimate of the state of a system. It is widely used in fields like meteorology, 
oceanography, hydrology, and environmental science.

During assimilation, the model state is transformed into observation space by interpolating the model 
state to each observation location. Observation space diagnostics are used
to visualize observations and model predictions (in observation space), and compare their statistical 
properties both before and after assimilation. Thereby, these diagnostics are key tools to model 
evaluation and prediction tasks.

The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) [@DART2009;@DARTcode] is a widely used community software
facility for ensemble data assimilation. DART merges diverse and complex observations into an internal data 
format called "observation sequence" files, which inherit metadata from each observation. Observation sequence
files including the model states are also generated, wherein the model states have been transformed into the 
observation space for direct comparisons and analysis. DARTâ€™s observation 
sequence files are central to its workflow, but their format and complexity can make them challenging to 
manipulate and analyze outside of the DART ecosystem. To manipulate and analyze the data using open-source 
tools a converter/interface is required.

pyDARTdiags is a Python package created to address this challenge. It provides tools to read, manipulate,
and analyze DART observation sequence files using familiar, modern Python libraries. With pyDARTdiags,
users can extract data, compute diagnostics, and create visualizations, all within reproducible Python 
workflows that integrate seamlessly with the broader scientific ecosystem.

# Statement of need

While DART provides robust tools for data assimilation, its observation sequence files are not easily
accessible for users wishing to perform custom diagnostics or integrate with Python-based workflows.
Existing DART tools for calculation of observation-space diagnostics are written in Fortran with 
visualization in MATLAB, which may not be freely accessible to all users. pyDARTdiags provides a single 
package to process and visualize observation space diagnostics. 

PyDARTdiags ingests observation sequences into an ObsSequence object which contains the metadata about
an observation sequence and a DataFrame containing all the data for the observations. 

This provides several advantages over the existing Fortran+MATLAB DART software: 

- Providing Python routines for reading and writing DART observation sequence files allows for the manipulation
  of observation sequences interactively via DataFrames using popular, open-source data science libraries. 
- Synthesizing the manipulation, analysis, and visualization of observation sequence files into a single Python 
  workflow improves portability and flexibility over the fractured Fortran/MATLAB workflow.
- Enabling calculation of observation-space statistics (e.g., RMSE, bias, total spread) on a DataFrame enables
  Data Assimilation researchers and users to write custom diagnostics based on DataFrames. By decoupling the 
  observation sequence file format from the DataFrame-based analysis, pyDARTdiags ensures that updates to the 
  DART file format do not disrupt user-created diagnostic routines.
- Supporting both static and interactive plotting (via Matplotlib and Plotly), facilities the processing of 
  observational datasets, quality control, and gaining insights about the spatial distribution of outliers 
  or other (technical) anomalies.
- Facilitating reproducible, scriptable workflows for observation-space diagnostics enables the inclusion in
  Jupyter notebook workflows. A concrete use case is its integration into the the CESM Regional Ocean and Carbon
  Configurator with Data Assimilation and Embedding (CROCODILE) project, which is a community platform for accelerating
  observationally-constrained regional ocean modeling. pyDARTdiags is used for observation space diagnostics 
  and model-to-observation comparison in the Jupyter notebook workflows for this project.

Examples for manipulating observation sequences, visualizing observational data, and generating diagnostic plots can be 
found in the [pyDARTdiags examples gallery](https://ncar.github.io/pyDARTdiags/examples/index.html).
A detailed description of the available diagnostic statistics and available plotting functions is provided in the
[user guide](https://ncar.github.io/pyDARTdiags/userguide/index.html).
